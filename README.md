# Library-Management-System
The system recognizes three type of members, faculty member, graduate student and undergraduate student.
The three type of members are derived classes from the class Person.
Each type has a limit on rentals and duration of rental.
To store books and members, I wrote two different Linked List class, one for Book objects and one for Person objects.
For the linked list class storing Person objects, I included a customized node (NodeP).
NodeP will at run time store the correct type of Person. (NodeP is a class)

There a total of 9 classes.
